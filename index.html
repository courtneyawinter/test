      <p><strong>Meet Courtney</strong></p>
      <p>Hello! I am an ambitious world traveler who has already seen amazing parts of the world at just the age of <strong>23.</strong><br>
      From touring the cities of Spain to walking the golden beaches of Aruba, I love to immerse myself in different cultures.<br>
      I am a small town girl who grew up in East Aurora, which is located near Buffalo New York, USA.<br>
      After creating some <strong>awesome</strong> life memories while abroad, I figured it would be a good idea<br>
      to keep track of my travels...so here we are!<br>
      <br>
      I cannot wait to continue my journey and share my love of exploring with you all.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Bon Voyage!</strong><br>
      <em>-C</em></p>
